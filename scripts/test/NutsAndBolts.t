=head1 NAME

NutsAndBolts.t - the most basic test script

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # a test script that emits TAP without using Kernel::System::UnitTest::Driver
    prove --verbose scripts/test/NutsAndBolts.t

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Essentially just for checking whether the installation is sane.
Especially for checking whether C<Dev::UnitTest::Run> ignores test scripts that
do not use the L<Kernel::System::UnitTest> framework.

When the environment variable SKIP_NUTSANDBOLTS_TEST is set, then all test cases in the file
are skipped. This behavior is used in F<scripts/test/UnitTest/Blacklist.t>

}

# just a dummy test that succeeds
say '1..1';
say 'ok 1 - easy success in NutsAndBolts.t';
