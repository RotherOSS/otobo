# sample apache config file as fastcgi proxy against otobo.psgi
# --

# The idea is that a FCGI server is started on the host machine.
# Apache then acts as a proxy and forwards its request to the FCGI server.
# The difference to an regular proxy is that Apache and FCGI server talk
# via the fastcgi protokol instead of HTTP.

# Note that running OTOBO as FCGI external server is not well tested.

# mod_proxy is already available in Apache 2.4.
# In addition to mod_proxy, the module mod_proxy_fcgi must be enabled:
#   sudo a2enmod proxy_fcgi

# Modules for FCGI support
#   sudo cpanm FCGI::ProcManager

# Start the FCGI-server serving /otobo
#   plackup --server FCGI --port 4000 --daemonize --nproc 10 /opt/otobo/bin/psgi-bin/otobo.psgi

# For debugging it might be useful to activate extra logging.
#   PLACK_URLMAP_DEBUG=1 plackup --server FCGI --port 4000 --daemonize --nproc 10 /opt/otobo/bin/psgi-bin/otobo.psgi

# See also:
#   https://metacpan.org/pod/Plack::Handler::FCGI

# Then link to this file from /etc/apache2/sites-enables/zzz_otobo.conf.
#   (cd /etc/apache2/sites-enabled && sudo ln -sf /opt/otobo/scripts/apache2-httpd-fcgi.include.conf zzz_otobo.conf)

# And then restart the webserver.
#   sudo systemctl restart apache2.service
