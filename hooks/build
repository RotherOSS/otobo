# Override the build hook of the automated builds on Docker Hub.
# The build hook is running in the root of the git sandbox. That is the directory contaning the file RELEASE.

# See https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/advanced/ for the list of preset environment variables.
# Additionally, the undocumented environment variable $BUILD_PATH is used. $BUILD_PATH can be set
# in the input field Build Context of the Docker Hub automated build GUI.

# The path to the Dockerfile is given relative to ./$BUILD_PATH in order to be compatible
# with the default build hook in Docker Hub. The default value of the Build Context is '/'. The build command works with this approach,
# because the resulting path will then be something like .//otobo.web.dockerfile.

# These commands can be uncommented for debugging:
#pwd
#ls
#docker -v
#printenv

# build the Docker image
