What is OTOBO?
===================================
[OTOBO](https://otobo.io) is an extremely flexible, web-based open-source ticketing tool.
The application is used for streamlining communication in service organisations
such as IT helpdesks, customer service centers, call centers etc.

It provides classical ticketing functionality, a knowledgebase/FAQs
with internal and external interface, helps to automate processes
and can be extended by an ITSM component with a CMDB to keep track
of IT components – or buildings, office plants, cars etc.

OTOBO is a fork based on ((OTRS)) Community Edition,
started in 2019 to go back to the roots and offer a 100 % free tool,
rooted in a strong community, and backed up by professional business services.
