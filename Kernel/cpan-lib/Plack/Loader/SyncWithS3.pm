=head1 NAME

Plack::Loader::SyncWithS3 - check for package events

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # to be used as a loader module in plackup
    plackup --server Gazelle --env deployment --port 5000 -I /opt/otobo/Kernel/cpan-lib --loader SyncWithS3  bin/psgi-bin/otobo.psgi

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module is largely inspired from L<Plack::Loader::Restarter>. Instead of watching for changed files, this module
looks in S3 whether OTOBO packages have been added, updated or removed. If so, the webserver is stopped, packages are reinstalled,
and the web server is restarted.

=head1 PUBLIC INTERFACE

# The constructor Plack::Loader::new() is not overridden, as additional attributes like 'builder' don't have to be initialized.

=head2 preload_app()

Keep the subroutine that creates a PSGI app around. Use it for recreating the PSGI app when the webserver is restarted.
