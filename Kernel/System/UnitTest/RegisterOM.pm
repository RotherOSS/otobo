package Kernel::System::UnitTest::RegisterOM;

=head1 NAME

Kernel::System::UnitTest::RegisterOM - set up C<$Kernel::OM> in test scripts

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Set up $Kernel::OM in test scripts.
    use Kernel::System::UnitTest::RegisterOM;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script provides support for running test scripts as standalone scripts.
It sets up the variable C<$Kernel::OM>.

Load this module in test scripts when the test driver C<$main::Self> is not needed.
When you need C<$main::Self> too, then you only need to load C<Kernel::System::UnitTest::RegisterDriver>
which loads this module implicitly.
