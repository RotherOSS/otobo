package Kernel::System::UnitTest::RegisterOM;

=head1 NAME

Kernel::System::UnitTest::RegisterOM - set up C<$Kernel::OM> in test scripts

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # Set up $Kernel::OM in test scripts.
    use Kernel::System::UnitTest::RegisterOM;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script provides support for running test scripts as standalone scripts.
It sets up the variable C<$Kernel::OM>.

Load this module in test scripts when the test driver C<$main::Self> is not needed.
When you need C<$main::Self> too, then you only need to load C<Kernel::System::UnitTest::RegisterDriver>
which loads this module implicitly.

Running a script, which loads this module, never emits the warning
"Name "Kernel::OM" used only once: possible typo". Even if the script has C<$Kernel::OM> only once.
This is because C<$Kernel::OM> is mentioned in this module. Also,  modules loaded by
C<Kernel::System::ObjectManager> mention C<$Kernel::OM>.
