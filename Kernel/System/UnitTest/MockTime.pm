=head1 NAME

Kernel::System::UnitTest::MockTime - helper functions for mocking time in unit tests

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Kernel::System::UnitTest::MockTime qw(:all);
    use Test2::V0;

    plan(3);

    my $FixedTime = FixedTimeSet();
    sleeep 1;
    my $Now = time;
    is( $Now, $FixedTime, 'time stayed fixed even after sleeping');

    my $NewFixedTime = $FixedTime + 123;
    FixedTimeAddSeconds(123);
    is( $FixedTimeGet(), $NewFixedTime);
    my $Now = time;
    is( $Now, $NewFixedTime);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

To be used in test scripts for mocking time.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=cut

# This time, seconds since 1970, will be used by 'time' when set.
my $FixedTime;

# override the core functions during the lifetime of the current process
BEGIN {

    *CORE::GLOBAL::time = sub {
        return $FixedTime // CORE::time();
    };

    *CORE::GLOBAL::localtime = sub {
        my ($Time) = @_;

        $Time //= $FixedTime // CORE::time();

        return CORE::localtime($Time);
    };

    *CORE::GLOBAL::gmtime = sub {
        my ($Time) = @_;

        $Time //= $FixedTime // CORE::time();

        return CORE::gmtime($Time);
    };
}

=head2 FixedTimeSet()

makes it possible to override the system time as long as this object lives.
You can pass an optional time parameter that should be used, if not,
the current system time will be used.

All calls to methods of Kernel::System::DateTime will use the given time afterwards.

    FixedTimeSet(366475757);         # with Timestamp
    FixedTimeSet($DateTimeObject);   # with previously created DateTime object
    FixedTimeSet();                  # set to current date and time

Returns:
    Timestamp

Be careful with using this this function as unwanted side effects may occur. One example
is the communication with S3 compatible storage. The S3 protocol includes a timestamp
which is used for a sanity check an the server side.

=cut

sub FixedTimeSet {
    my ($TimeToSave) = @_;

    if ( $TimeToSave && ref $TimeToSave eq 'Kernel::System::DateTime' ) {
        $FixedTime = $TimeToSave->ToEpoch();
    }
    else {
        $FixedTime = $TimeToSave // CORE::time();
    }

    return $FixedTime;
}

=head2 FixedTimeGet()

get the current fixed time. Undef when no time has been fixed.

    my $FixedTime = FixedTimeGet();

Returns:
    Timestamp

=cut

sub FixedTimeGet {
    return $FixedTime;
}

=head2 FixedTimeUnset()

restores the regular system time behavior.

Returns:
    undef

=cut

sub FixedTimeUnset {
    undef $FixedTime;

    return $FixedTime;
}

=head2 FixedTimeAddSeconds()

adds a number of seconds to the fixed system time which was previously
set by FixedTimeSet(). You can pass a negative value to go back in time.

Returns:
    Timestamp

=cut

sub FixedTimeAddSeconds {
    my ($SecondsToAdd) = @_;

    return unless defined $FixedTime;

    $FixedTime += $SecondsToAdd;

    return $FixedTime;
}

1;
