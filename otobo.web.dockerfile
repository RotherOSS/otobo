# This is the build file for the OTOBO web docker image.
# The services OTOBO web and OTOBO daemon use the same image.
# There is also an extra build target otobo-web-kerberos that adds support for Kerberos.

# Use the latest maintainance release of the Perl 5.38.x series as the base.
#
# The Debian version is explicitly set to bookworm, that is Debian 12.
# This avoids a surprising change of the version of Debian when the image
# is rebuilt, especially when the image for a new release of OTOBO is built.
# Note that the minor version of Debian may change between builds.
#
# The individual build targets may add additional Debian or CPAN packages.
