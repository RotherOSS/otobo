# NOTE: Do not set DOCKER_REPO in this script.
#       Because DOCKER_REPO is misused in hook scripts as an indication
#       that the script is called by an automated Docker Hub build.
#       Setting IMAGE_NAME is OK.

# Just a small helper for building the docker images locally.
# For productive use please use the images from Docker Hub.

# The variable that are defined here follow the same convention as in
# https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/builds/advanced/.
# This means that local build can use the same build hook as Docker Hub builds.
